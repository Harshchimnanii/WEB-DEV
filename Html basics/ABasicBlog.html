            <h1>About Mahatama Gandhi</h1>
            <p>Mahatma Gandhi, also known as the Father of the Nation, was the key figure in India’s freedom struggle. He believed in the principles of non-violence (Ahimsa) and truth (Satyagraha), and led several movements like the Salt March and Quit India Movement to protest against British rule. Gandhi’s approach inspired civil rights movements around the world and proved that great change can be achieved through peace and persistence. His leadership, humility, and deep moral values earned him respect globally.</p>

            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose, popularly known as Netaji, was a bold and revolutionary leader who took a more militant approach toward India’s independence. Unlike Gandhi, Bose believed that freedom must be taken by force if necessary. He founded the Indian National Army (INA) and allied with countries like Japan to fight against the British Empire. His famous words, “Give me blood, and I will give you freedom,” continue to inspire generations. Despite differences in methods, his love for the country was unmatched.</p>

            <p>Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was a visionary leader, jurist, and social reformer who played a pivotal role in framing the Indian Constitution. Born into a Dalit family, he faced social discrimination from a young age but overcame all obstacles through education. He fought tirelessly for the rights of the marginalized, especially the Dalits, and promoted the values of equality and justice.

            <p>Bhagat Singh was a fearless revolutionary who gave his life for India’s freedom at the young age of 23. Deeply disturbed by British atrocities, he joined the struggle early and believed in taking bold actions to shake the foundations of colonial rule. He became famous for bombing the Central Legislative Assembly (without harming anyone) and shouting “Inquilab Zindabad” to awaken the nation. His courage, sacrifice, and fiery spirit made him a youth icon and national hero.
